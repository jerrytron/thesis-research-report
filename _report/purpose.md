Creating and using the technology I’m describing in experiences that an audience interacts with is _hard_. Even great designers struggle with this. It’s even harder to coordinate all of the pieces of technology to work together! I happen to have a fair bit of experience writing software code and working with electronics and it is still hard to make it all work together, as I learned while developing my first escape room game.

Unfortunately it isn’t reasonable to force every designer to become proficient in software code or electronics (or a host of other skills that can come into play). What do we usually do with problems like these? **We make tools!** Imagine being a graphic designer without tools like Photoshop. Imagine if you only had Microsoft Paint to work with. Is it _possible_ to create beautiful graphics? Sure, but how much additional time and effort would it take? If building live-action games and immersive experiences is difficult for designers that do have the necessary experience, what about those who don’t? Tools need to be designed to specifically address the needs of experience designers building live-action games and similar work.

This study was performed with the goal of better understanding the limitations live-action game designers face when using immersive technology, as well as verifying that the use or increased usage of technology was even desired. This led to the formation of my research question:

**As the complexity of immersive technology increases, how could access and flexibility be increased to empower story-driven experience designers?**

In other words, how can we build tools for experience designers that make it easier to focus more on creating and less on technical problems? How can tools be designed that reduced technical barriers while increasing the creative possibilities? Can there be a _Photoshop_ for designing immersive games?
