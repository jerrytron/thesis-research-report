I was first inspired to do research into immersive design tools after designing, implementing, and installing my first live-action “escape room” game in 2017, an intensive process working with my project design partner, David Pisa. Our core design goal was a pushback against trends we had seen in other games, specifically around the use of large numbers of props, clues, and objects scattered around the game space. We conceived _Utopia_, a room that would begin as a deceivingly empty and sterile space, and focused on reveal and surprise.

The catch was it would require either deeply involved game masters to run or need to be heavily automated, and considering my years of software and electronics experience the choice was easy. The task, however, was not. I spent countless hours wiring and testing devices with code, spending more time shopping, purchasing, and connecting electronics and hardware than on the aspects of the design an audience would ever even see. The result was a functional, fully automated game that even won a [Golden Lock-In Award](https://roomescapeartist.com/2017/09/17/riddle-room-utopia-review/) the year it opened.

The problem was the months of delays before opening followed by months of debugging seemingly unpredictable software and electronics issues. I didn’t realize it at the time, but automation at our level was rare and there were good reasons for it. Eventually issues were fixed and support dropped to a minimum of time. _Utopia_ continues to run at the time this was written, but it took an extreme toll on our health with long hours and stress; was over budget by nearly 25%; and very little of the work can be transferable to future projects.

After talking with numerous professionals in the industry and searching for new tools and devices better suited to creating complex immersive work like live-action games, I came up short. At the same time I was inspired by many of the new microcomputing technologies, including more advanced iterations of Arduino and Raspberry Pi style products, new wireless capabilities, and open-source creative tools. In an infomercial-like fashion I thought, “There’s got to be a better way!”, and so this became the topic of my thesis research.
