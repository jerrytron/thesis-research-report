Surveys and interviews were conducted with highly experienced live-action game designers all over the world to better understand their frustrations and desires involving immersive technology in their work. Most importantly perhaps, the research showed that designers were highly motivated to innovate and use immersive technology to that end, even with the time and financial risks associated with immersive technology. There were four primary challenges that the research identified as significant barriers for designers in live-action games:

1. Using technology means adding a number of specialized technical skills on top of the numerous skills already required to design experiences such as these.
1. It is difficult to quickly test early design concepts with technology
1. It is difficult to scale working prototypes from experiment to audience ready.
1. It is time consuming and expensive to support and maintain immersive technology.

With any design work time and money end up being your most valuable resources.
