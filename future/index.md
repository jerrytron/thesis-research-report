Functional prototypes must first be developed that target the barriers and desires of experiences designers creating live-action games. Once these exist they should be immediately put into the hands of designers, with support of the creators and researchers, to observe how they are approached and used in real design settings. Long term support is important for tools when the resulting designs may be running for years at a time. Compatibility with existing systems and tools is also important to ensure the tools are as flexible as possible, allowing for many fascinating uses that even the creators of tools wonâ€™t expect. Both longevity of support and compatibility are increased by using open standards, releasing the specifications for how the tools communicate, and even open sourcing software code and electronics designs. This helps build and sustain communities around the tools even if the creators are no longer supporting them.

I believe that we are at or nearing an inflection point in immersive design, where available technology, designer motivation to innovate, and consumer demand will provide the momentum needed for a new generation of immersive design tools to emerge that allow for some truly spectacular new experiences.
